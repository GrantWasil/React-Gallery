# React-Photo-Gallery

An application built using the [React](https://reactjs.org) library to render photos from [flickr](http://flickr.com) by using a search form.

See my other work at my [Website](www.grantwasil.com)

## Motivation
This was project seven of the TeamTreehouse Fullstack JavaScript tech-degree. I plan on using this technology to create a portfolio for a graphic artist.

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [React](https://reactjs.com)
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

## Features
The website handles "tag" requests and filters through flickr to find relevant photos. You can also click on one of the three "recommended" buttons to get a demonstration of the application.
